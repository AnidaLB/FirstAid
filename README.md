# FirstAidPocketEdition
IBU mobile Android application

First Aid Pocket Edition is an application that contains first aid tutorials, tests and emergency help information. 
Users with no/very little knowledge of first aid will first be able to go trough various tutorials with basic and more complex injuries descriptions and descriptions of the help they may provide. 
Once they complete reading tutorials, users can start the test with different cases described, injuries shown, and decide, based on their knowledge from the tutorials, what to do to save someone's life.

Application will be suitable for emergency situations, while having an option with quick descriptions of first aid, based on the category the user chooses, when dealing with some injury. ( for example, user finds someone with a broken leg, calls 122, opens application- section „breaks“- and has the information of how to help the person in need.)

The application will help young people learn about this important skill- saving life, while having fun, on their Android devices.
